## **Day 1 – Learning How I Can Use Git**

*February 22, 2026*



Today, my partner and I focused on learning how to use Git. Even though it was our first time actually downloading and using it, we were already somewhat familiar with it because our professor had previously taught us some basic Git commands in class. That background knowledge helped us feel less overwhelmed while starting out.



Even though we had heard about Git from our friends and classmates before, we had never fully explored GitHub on our own. At the beginning, there were still many new terms like repository, commit, push, and pull that we needed to understand more clearly. We reviewed what each command does and why version control is important in managing projects.



We created our first repository and practiced making commits. It was interesting to see how Git tracks changes in files and keeps a history of everything we do. I learned that commits are very helpful because they allow us to go back to previous versions if something goes wrong.



One important realization today was how useful Git is for teamwork. It makes collaboration easier and prevents people from accidentally overwriting each other’s work. Because we already had some basic knowledge from our professor, we were able to understand the workflow faster and feel more confident while practicing.



Overall, today was a productive introduction to using Git more seriously. Even though it was our first time officially using it, we did not feel completely lost because of the lessons we had before.



Tomorrow, we plan to:



Practice more Git commands

Create more folders for our Activity in Web System

Learn more about connecting a local project to GitHub





## **Day 2 – Collaborating and Uploading Files to Git**

*February 23, 2026*



Today, I started creating and uploading files to our Git repository together with my partner. Since we already learned the basic Git commands yesterday, I felt more comfortable working with the repository. This time, we focused more on collaboration and making sure our files were properly organized.



We added new files for our Web System activity and practiced committing and pushing our changes to GitHub. It was interesting to see how our work syncs online and becomes accessible to both of us. I also learned the importance of writing clear commit messages so we can easily track what changes were made.



Working with a partner made me realize how important it is to always pull the latest updates before making changes. This helps avoid conflicts and keeps our project updated. Even though it was still new to us, the process felt smoother compared to our first day.



Overall, today helped me understand better how Git works in a collaborative environment, not just individually.



Tomorrow, we plan to:



Start organizing our project structure more clearly

Explore more Git commands

Continue improving our repository





## **Day 3 – Writing My Progress Log and Planning My Portfolio**



February 24, 2026



Today, I started writing my progress.md file to document my daily progress and updates. I realized that keeping a daily log is helpful because it allows me to reflect on what I have accomplished and what I still need to improve. It also keeps my work organized and easier to review in the future.



Aside from updating my progress file, I also began designing and visualizing how my Portfolio website would look. I spent time thinking about the layout, the sections I want to include, and the overall style. I imagined how I want to introduce myself and present my skills in a clean and simple way.



Even though I have not fully started coding the design yet, planning it carefully gave me a clearer direction. I learned that visualization is an important step before development because it prevents confusion later on.



Overall, today was more focused on planning and organizing rather than heavy coding, but it was still very productive.



Tomorrow, we plan to:



Start turning the design into actual code

Create the basic structure of the portfolio

Continue updating the progress log







## **Day 4 – Starting to Code My Portfolio Website**

*February 25, 2026*



Today, I continued working on my portfolio by starting to code the design that I visualized yesterday. I used HTML and CSS to build the basic structure and style of the website. It was exciting to finally see my ideas slowly turn into something visible on the screen.



I focused on creating the layout and styling the sections properly. There were small challenges while adjusting the spacing and alignment, but I managed to fix them by experimenting with different CSS properties. This helped me understand more about how design and structure work together.



I am also considering using JavaScript to make the website more interactive. However, I am still deciding how I want to implement it and what features would be useful without making the website too complicated.



Overall, today felt productive because I was able to bring my planned design to life through coding.



Tomorrow, we plan to:



Continue improving the design

Add more content to the portfolio

Decide whether to implement JavaScript features







## **Day 5 – Improving and Updating My Website**

*February 26, 2026*



Since we did not have a class today, I decided to use the extra time to improve and update my portfolio website. I plan to add more details about myself, including my skills, background, and other important information that can make my portfolio more complete.



I realized that a portfolio is not just about design, but also about how clearly I present who I am and what I can do. Because of this, I want to make sure the content is organized and easy to read. I will also review my previous code to see if there are parts that I can improve or clean up.



Having extra time without class gives me the opportunity to focus more on polishing my work. I hope to make the website more detailed and professional as I continue developing it.



Tomorrow, I plan to:



Add more sections to my portfolio

Refine the design and layout

Continue updating my progress log
