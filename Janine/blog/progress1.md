Day 1 – Learning How to Use and Collaborate on GitHub
February 22, 2026

Today marks the first step of my website creation journey. Instead of jumping straight into coding, I spent the day figuring out how to use GitHub and understanding how collaboration works.

At first, it felt overwhelming,there were repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests, but as I explored more, everything slowly started to make sense. I learned how to create a repository, push my changes, and pull updates from collaborators. This day helped me realize that building a website is not just about writing code, but also about managing versions and working with others efficiently.

By the end of the day, I felt more confident knowing that I could now collaborate properly and keep my work organized.
