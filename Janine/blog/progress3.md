Day 3  – Polishing Content and Starting the Design

Today, February 26, I worked on improving and polishing the content of my website. I revised the text, made sure everything was clear, and adjusted the layout to make it more presentable. After that, I started experimenting with the design by thinking about colors, fonts, and adding images as a design.

This part made the website feel more personal and alive. Seeing my content combined with early design choices made me excited to continue improving it.
