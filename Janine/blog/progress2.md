Day 2 – Creating the Basic HTML Structure
February 24, 2026

On the second day, I finally started working on the actual website. I focused on building the basic structure of my HTML file. I created the main layout, including the head and body sections, and began organizing where each part of the content would go.

This step may seem simple, but it felt rewarding because I could finally see the foundation of my website taking shape. I learned how important structure is before adding designs or advanced features.

Today was all about setting up a clean and understandable layout that I can improve on in the following days.
