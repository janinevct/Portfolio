        <div class="about-text">
            <p>
                Hello! I am a second-year Bachelor of Science in InformationTechnology (BSIT) student in Bicol University, who believes in continuous growth and self-improvement. I value learning, creativity, and the small experiences that shape who I am today.
            </p>

            <p>
                Outside of academics, I enjoy expressing myself through simple creative pursuits, appreciating meaningful conversations, and finding inspiration in everyday moments. I believe that passion, dedication, and kindness are just as important as skills.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am someone who strives to become better each day — not only professionally, but also personally. I look forward to discovering new opportunities, building genuine connections, and creating a future I can be proud of.

    <h2 class="section-title">Hobbies & Interests</h2>

    <div class="about-text">
        <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy baking, where I get to express my creativity
            and patience through making desserts and pastries. Baking has also
            helped me develop discipline and attention to detail.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am currently running a small baking business, which allows me to
            practice time management, responsibility, and customer communication
            while balancing my studies.
        </p>

        <p>
            I also love listening to music, which helps me relax, stay motivated,
            and maintain focus while studying or working on projects.

    <div class="about-text">
        <p>
            As a woman, I consider my strengths to be resilience, creativity,
            and determination. I am adaptable and willing to learn from both
            challenges and mistakes.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am detail-oriented, patient, and capable of balancing multiple
            responsibilities — from academics to managing a small business.
        </p>

        <p>
            I believe in continuous self-improvement and confidently pursue
            my goals while staying grounded and compassionate.

        <h3>Rock Paper Scissors Game (Java)</h3>

        <p>
            This project is a simple console-based Rock Paper Scissors game
            developed using Java. The game allows the user to choose between
            rock, paper, or scissors, while the computer randomly generates
            its choice.
        </p>

        <p>
            The program compares both choices, determines the winner based
            on game rules, and displays the result. This project helped me
            understand basic Java concepts such as conditional statements,
            loops, user input, and random number generation.
